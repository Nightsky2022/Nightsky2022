- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nightsky2022
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and the tech industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java on my own but I'm considering a bootcamp or even studying software development in the near future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects after I have the Java basics down and have also been offered by a friend to give pull requests a go in due time.
- 📫 How to reach me ... just drop me a message nightsky2022github@gmail.com
